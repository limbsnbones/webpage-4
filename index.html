    <h1>Minecraft Wooden Planks RANKED</h1>
    Hi gamer, fellow gamer here. I thought I'd state facts today and rank each original Wooden Plank Block from absolute best to dog-shit worst (not counting the Crimson and Warped Plank blocks from the Nether update.) These rankings are both the gospel truth and my personal opinion. I will not be taking criticism.

    <h3>Jungle Planks.</h3>
    This is probably going to be very controversial, and you may be angry, but I raise you this: pink is one of the best colors on earth. Jungle wood is not a classic by any means, but as a society we need to grow past tradition and think outside the block. Imagine you're building your base and when you step back to admire your handy-work, its tinted pink. That's just supreme. Do not bring gender into this conversation because my gender is unfathomable and I will win any argument you want to have.

    <h3>Spruce Planks.</h3>
    The PERFECT balance between Oak and Dark Oak, Spruce is a warm brown that reminds me of brown sugar. It is the middle of the spectrum and goes very nicely with the various kinds of Stone Blocks. Also has a fantastic rustic look that adds a special touch to any cave base.

    <h3>Oak Planks.</h3>
    Classic! Nostalgic! Versatile! But not the nicest looking. If you aren't one for building things and would rather mine, explore, farm, or whatever then this block will sustain your every need. However. If you were trying to make a cool fancy house or something but the only wood you used was Oak, I would be disappointed. Lots of people would be disappointed. Get creative.

    <h3>Dark Oak Planks.</h3>
      This is not a public forum, so I'm going to be brave here. Dark Oak really isn't all that great. It's not ugly, and it looks really smart in a variety of builds, but I just don't like it all that much. Makes a room feel smaller because of how dark it is, and needs a color palette to work in a build. I could get hate-crimed for this.

    <h1 id="box5">D Rank</h1>
    <img src="birch planks.png" alt="birch planks">
    <h3>Birch Planks.</h3>
    Way too light to be the main block in any build. Reminds me of plain oatmeal with nothing in it. Good for creating contrast, and can look nice in some builds as decoration, but overall is kinda gray. Not a fan.
  </div>
  <div id="content-box">
    <h1 id="box6">F Rank</h1>
    <img src="acacia planks.png" alt="acacia planks">
    <h3>Acacia Planks.</h3>
    Is anyone really surprised by this? Do I even need to explain myself? No, no I do not. If you like staring at things that are ugly then your favorite blocks are probably Acacia Wood and all the Concrete blocks. Only acceptable use is for quick crafting during a speedrun, and maybe using the regular Acacia Wood block for it's silvery bark. Otherwise go to hell
